# GPR-GAN

Welcome to the GPR-GAN repository, developed as part of the research efforts at the CSIM Lab, led by Professor Jing Li, a specialist in high-precision shallow subsurface geophysics. 
The lab focuses on pioneering inversion imaging techniques to address key challenges in environmental sustainability and urban space applications. This code provides provides a 
tool for generating ground penetrating radar data using DL.
