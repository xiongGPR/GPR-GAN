Deep learning has gained traction in ground penetrating radar (GPR) tasks. however, the scarcity of adequate training data remains 
a significant constraint. This paper presents a structure-adaptive GPR-GAN for generating GPR defect data. We evaluated the performance 
of GPR-GAN using three open-source datasets and three state-of-the-art detection networks (FasterRCNN, SSD, and YOLOv5). The results 
demonstrate GPR-GAN's robust generalization capabilities, adapting to GPR data generation tasks involving diverse targets, frequencies, 
and equipment. The generated GPR data also significantly enhances the performance of the detection networks. GPR-GAN offers 
a powerful a data support tool for deep learning research in GPR.
